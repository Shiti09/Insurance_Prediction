# Insurance Prediction

Welcome to my repository! Here, I'm excited to share my latest project on insurance premium prediction, leveraging a dataset sourced from Kaggle. With 1338 instances and 13 columns, this dataset offers a rich repository of information crucial for understanding and predicting insurance premiums.

# What Is an Insurance Premium?
When you have an insurance policy, the company charges you money in exchange for that coverage. That cost is known as the insurance premium.

The basic role of insurance is to provide financial protection, by offering a method of risk transfer through cost coverage in the event of an accident. However, to be able to claim against the risk coverage given, customers are required to make premium payments during the coverage period. Basically, the risk experienced by each individual is different, so it is natural that each insured pays a different premium, according to
the high risk faced. The difference in the cost of premiums is based on the heterogeneity of the insurance portfolio. Insurance companies consider several factors when calculating an individual's insurance premiums.

# WHAT IS HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM PREDICTION?
To put it in relatively simple terms, it's a technique that uses statistics, analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze data and help assess the likelihood of a future event and predict a premium for an instance. 

## The Steps taken for this project is 
### Data Preprocessing:

- Data Collection: Obtained the dataset from the Kaggle.
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Feature Selection: Identified relevant features and attributes for analysis.
- Data Transformation: Encoded categorical variables, normalize/standardize numerical data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Statistical Analysis: Computed descriptive statistics, correlations, and distributions.
- Data Visualization: Generated graphs (histograms, box plots, scatter plots, etc.) to understand relationships and patterns in the data.
- Identify Insights: Analyzed trends and potential influential factors on premium prediction.

### Model Building:

- For Regression Problem algorithm decided to predict the feature Premium.
- Models used : Linear regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Random forest, Decision tree, K-Nearest Neighbour regressor, Support Vector Regressor.

### Creating Flask Module:

- Developed a Flask-based web application to showcase the trained models.
- Integrated user interface elements for user input and model predictions.
- Implemented functionality to interact with the trained models for regression.

### Deployment on Render:

- Deployed the Flask application on Render to host the application and make it accessible to users.

To find the predicted premium the user needs to insert the mentioned columns and then the model will predict a premium.
